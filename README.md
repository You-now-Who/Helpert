## About Project

We all remember the stress and confusion that comes with applying to college. It's like navigating a maze while juggling a hundred things at once! 😫 That's why we came up with Helpart, the ultimate hackathon project designed specifically to help high schoolers like you conquer the college application process with ease. 🚀

## Features

### 📅Deadline Reminder: 
Say goodbye to missed deadlines and hello to organization! Helpart keeps track of all your application deadlines and sends you friendly reminders, so you'll never be caught off guard.

### 🔍 College Explorer: 
With Helpart's College Explorer, you can dive into a treasure trove of information about different colleges and universities. From admission requirements to campus life, it's your one-stop shop for all things college-related.

### 📝 Application Tracker: 
Stay on top of your applications like a pro! Helpart helps you track the progress of each application, from submission to acceptance (fingers crossed!). No more guessing games or frantic searches for confirmation emails.

### 📆 Study Scheduler:
Balancing college applications and schoolwork can be tough. But fear not! Helpart's Study Scheduler helps you plan your study sessions, ensuring you have enough time for both school and applications. It's all about finding that perfect balance!

## Development Challenges

The journey to create Helpart wasn't without its fair share of challenges. We encountered a few roadblocks along the way, such as:

🔌 API Compatibility: Integrating multiple APIs can be tricky, as each has its own quirks and requirements. We had to spend some quality time debugging and ensuring smooth data retrieval.

⌛ Time Management: As with any hackathon, time was our biggest challenge. We had ambitious goals and a tight deadline, but our team rallied together, burned the midnight oil, and made it happen!

_\* The integration of all things together was the major part we wanted to make sure that it is easy to contribute._
